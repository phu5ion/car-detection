# car-detection
The overall objective is to detect and measure the distance between cars, and to raise an alarm when there is a possibility of an accident due to close distances. Specifically for this project, we develop code that:
1. Takes in frontal dash cam footage from a driver's perspective
2. Segments the videos into still images
3. Performs car (object) detection using Faster-RCNN
4. Output a distance measurement between the cars.  

This project was done in collaboration with @tanchongmin.
